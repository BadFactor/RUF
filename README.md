# RUF
Exchange File Format, written in secured Rustlang!

The name comes from "to be rough"!
It should say or mean that it is hard, strong & flexible!

## GOALS

- Fully Open Source
- Parallel and fully Multithreaded File Format!
- File Format is modular, because of his widely spreaded Exchanged File Features
  to OpenCollada aso.
- 3D Exchange (*.3ruf, pronounced "three rough")
